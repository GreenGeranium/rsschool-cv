### Briefly About Myself:
I've been doing programming since school, I've written in Python and C#, but JS hooked me the most. I read articles about JavaScript, about the internal structure of the language, watch conferences on OOP and new technologies. I like to learn something new.
I am responsible and punctual, I quickly have a way with people, and I also have a mathematical mindset..
In my free time I study foreign languages, play musical instruments, and also study Russian folklore.
